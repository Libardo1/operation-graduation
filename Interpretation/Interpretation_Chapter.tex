\chapter[Interpretation]{Interpretation of Results}

Since the experimental result is phrased in terms of a production cross section
times a branching ratio, an interpretation step is required to draw physics conclusions
about the non-Standard Model Higgs sector. A number of standard benchmark scenarios
are provided by the LHC Higgs Cross Section Working Group \cite{mssm_xsec_wg} which span 
a range of plausible model structures.  The interpretation under these benchmarks
is explained in Section~\ref{sec:interp_benchmark}, while in Section~\ref{sec:interp_new_benchmark} we examine other scenarios
that fall outside the standard benchmarks.

\section{Standard Benchmark Scenarios}
\label{sec:interp_benchmark}
Since there are so many analyses at the LHC that deal, either directly or indirectly,
with non-SM Higgs bosons, a set of standard benchmark scenarios are used to bring
order to the chaos and allow for potentially easier comparison and combination 
of results.  These benchmark scenarios are a joint effort of ATLAS, CMS, and 
theorists.  The benchmarks generally set the parameters of the model under inspection,
and then calculate the production cross sections and branching fractions for that
model; then each analysis can convert its exclusions in cross section times 
branching fraction to an exclusion in (usually) $m_A$/tan$\beta$.  The production
cross sections are calculated using the Santander matching algorithm \cite{santander} 
and generally follow the scenario prescriptions suggested in \cite{Carena-2}.


\subsection{$m_h^{mod}$ Minus Scenario}
This scenario is generated with the following setup:
\begin{itemize}
    \item HIGLU for calculating the total Higgs production cross section due to gluon fusion \cite{higlu}
    \item ggH\@NNLO for next to next to leading order gluon fusion calculations \cite{gghnnlo} 
    \item bbH\@NNLO (5FS) for next to next to leading order $b$-quark associated production cross sections with the five-flavor scheme \cite{bbhnnlo}
    \item bbH (4FS) scans for Higgstrahlung off bottom quarks in the 4-flavor scheme \cite{bbh_4fs_1} \cite{bbh_4fs_2}
\end{itemize}
