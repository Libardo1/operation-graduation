\chapter[Signal Kinematics]{Signal Kinematics}

 
Once the trigger and cuts have been applied to the data, the events that remain can be signal, background, or a mixture of the two.  
It then falls to understanding the kinematics of the signal and background to look for features that can
provide enough discrimination to detect the presence of the signal.  In this case, that means reconstructing
the invariant mass of the leading two jets in the event, which will create a smoothly falling power
law distribution in QCD background but a resonance structure in signal.  The kinematics of the signal
distribution then come into play in a few major ways:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Signal Jet \pt Distributions:  By examining the \pt distributions 
    of the Higgs daughters, and the associated $b$-jet(s), 
    we can get a better understanding of what might be optimal jet \pt cuts for future iterations of this analysis. 
    \item Signal Jet Combinatorics: A perfectly good signal event can be inadvertently 
    turned into a type of background if the associated $b$-jet is 
    chosen when reconstructing the Higgs; unfortunately these combinatorial mistakes can arise easily when 
    there are 3 $b$-jets but only two jets being used for reconstruction.
    \item Mass Resolution: The Higgs resonance width depends on $m_A$/tan$\beta$, with intrinsic widths
of up to a few tens of GeV; however, if energy is lost to FSR, the resonance can be much wider and this makes
the signal much more difficult to distinguish from the background.
    \item Eigenvector Rotation: In signal events, especially those with low FSR and good mass resolution,
    there is a correlation between $m_{bb}$, $p_{T,1}$ and $p_{T,2}$ that is not present in the resonance-less
    background.  By constructing a 3x3 tensor out of these three variables in signal, and rotating the analysis so the
    discriminating variable falls along the leading eigenvector of that tensor, we can take advantage of the correlations
    in signal and boost the signal-to-background ratio.
\end{itemize}


\section{Signal Jet \pt Distributions}

An important place to start is with the \pt distributions of the jets after the trigger
and cuts have been applied.  Using truth-matching in the Monte Carlo, we can identify
which jets are daughters of the Higgs and which are associated $b$-jet(s).  Since
the Higgs is a heavy particle, its decay jets tend to have higher \pt than the associated
$b$-jet(s), which can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:pt_higgs_and_associated_jets}. 
However, in this plot, $b$-tagging has been applied so an important potential
component is missing: how does the event topology change when we also include 
non-$b$-jets, which can potentially be high \pt as well.

%----------------------------------------------

As it turns out, the presence of additional non-$b$ jets can have a significant 
effect in signal.  Since the hard scatter has only $b$-jets in the final state, the
extra jet(s) must come from other sources like initial state radiation (ISR) or 
final state radiation (FSR).  This can smear out the signal, as explained in more detail
in Section~\ref{sec:mass_res}, and combating the effects became a significant part of the
analysis.


\section{Signal Jet Combinatorics}
\label{sec:combinatorics}
An important point when trying to reconstruct the Higgs is which two $b$-tagged jets (of the
three or more available) should be used in reconstruction.  If the associated $b$-jet is accidentally
selected, then the Higgs will be mis-reconstructed and the sensitivity will suffer.  At the same time,
since the mass of the Higgs is not known, tools like a kinematic fit are not available to
help with the combinatorics.  In Figure~\ref{fig:combinatorics}, we use the MC truth
information in the signal MC to plot how often the Higgs decays to various pairs of jets
within the event; we find that especially for masses above 350 GeV or so it usually decays to
the leading and second $b$-tagged jets in the event (with about a 70\% probability).
    
\begin{figure}[hbt]

  \caption{The percentage probability of the Higgs decaying to a given pair of $b$-tagged jets in signal MC,
    as a function of the generated Higgs mass.  The assumption being checked is that the majority of
    the time, the Higgs decays to the leading two $b$-tagged jets (blue line), so that reconstructing with these jets
    will yield the correct combinatorics.  That assumption is correct 60-70\% of the time for $m_A>$350 GeV,
    with the remaining 30-40\% of events being spread out over many other combinations of jets.

    \caption{After making the requirement that the leading two jets in the event are $b$-tagged,
    the signal MC can be split into events that pass this requirement and those events that fail.
    For each sample, we ask how often the Higgs decays to the leading two $b$-jets in the event,
    or in other words, how likely it is to get the combinatorics of the Higgs reconstruction correct.
    The combinatorics for the events passing the requirement are correct about 80\% of the time for
    high m$_H$, while for events failing the requirement the combinatorics success rate is only about 10\%.}
\end{figure}
                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                    
If we require only that the leading two $b$-tagged jets be used in reconstruction, there can                                          
still be events in our sample where the leading two $b$-tagged jets in the event are not                                              
the leading two jets overall--for example, there can be a very hard light jet, and the $b$-tagged                                     
jets are the second and third jets in $p_T$.  When we introduce a cut that eliminates these events,                                 
by requiring that the leading two jets in the event be $b$-tagged, both the signal to background                                      
ratio improves (this cut is about 25\% efficient in background, and over 90\% efficient                                             
in signal) and the mass resolution is improved in signal as the events that are rejected have                                           
hard FSR present and the reconstructed $m_{bb}$ is far from the generated $m_A$.    

%The first strategy for recovering mass resolution is to require, as part of the cut flow,
%that the leading 2 jets in the event be $b$-tagged.  Before this cut is applied, it is
%possible to have signal events in which there is hard ISR or FSR (light jet radiation),
%and/or $b$-jets from the signal process that are high-$p_T$ but do not pass the $b$-tagging.
%The price of this cut is a loss in signal efficiency, which varies by $m_A$ but can be 
%seen in Figure~\ref{fig:combinatorics} to be about 30-40\% above $m_A$=350 GeV or so.
%However, Figure~\ref{fig:background_eff_cutflow} shows that the background also drops, 
%by a higher amount that varies based on the exact background in question, so that the net 
%effect on signal/background for this cut is neutral or favorable.
 

Quantifying the effect of this cut on the mass resolution is a little tricky because of the
$m_{bb}$ shape in signal, which is highly asymmetric.  In order to make some progress, though,
we define the ``left'' and ``right'' shoulders of the distribution, where the left shoulder
corresponds to the low-mass side of the $m_{bb}$ distribution, where the reconstructed mass 
is below the peak for a given signal mass point,
and the right shoulder is the part of the distribution above the peak.  Then we can define
a threshold corresponding to 20\% of the peak height, and ask for the left-shoulder and right-shoulder
windows where the distribution is above the threshold (a schematic illustrating the ``shoulder''
definition can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:shoulders}, for a low-mass and high-mass example).  
The right shoulder is much narrower,
and any events in the high-mass tail (above the generated value for $m_A$) arise from 
combinatorial mis-reconstructions.  The left shoulder, where FSR and combinatorics are
at play, is significantly wider but the metric of left shoulder width in GeV shows a decrease
from 40\% (at $m_A$=800 GeV) to 300\% (at $m_A$=250 GeV)
once we require that the leading two jets in the event be $b$-tagged.  The widths of the shoulders
for all mass points, before and after this cut is applied, can be seen in Table~\ref{tab:signal_mass_RMS_compare}.

\section{Mass Resolution}
\label{sec:mass_res}

%A consistent refrain throughout this analysis is the challenge of poor mass resolution when reconstructing
%the signal, especially in the low-mass tail for high values of $m_A$. The 
%issue is important because a poorly-reconstructed (very wide)
%signal peak can easily be confused with a background normalization error, which makes the analysis less
%sensitive to small signals. This section will summarize the efforts to make the mass resolution as good
%as possible; some tactics did produce an improvement while others did not.  In brief, the tactics
%attempted include the following:

Although the cut on the $b$-tag status of the leading two jets improves the combinatorics and 
mass resolution, the width of the $m_{bb}$ distributions after this cut still remain very broad, 
which makes them challenging to distinguish from background.  In this section, we document a number
of investigations into the mass resolution, and some attempts to recover FSR or mitigate its effects.
In brief summary, this section includes discussion of the following mass resolution topics: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item validation that FSR has a relatively larger effect for high-mass Higgs events than for low-mass ones
    \item investigation of modifications to the jet reconstruction parameters, and the effect on the mass resolution 
    \item an FSR recovery algorithm that looks for additional jets near ($\Delta R<$1.0) the $b$-jets
    in signal candidate events, with the goal including the additional jets in the reconstruction
    \item an FSR recovery algorithm that looks for additional hard ($p_T>$80 GeV) non-$b$-tagged
    jets in signal candidate events, for possible inclusion when reconstructing the Higgs 
    \item a change of basis where the discriminating variable is changed from the reconstructed mass, $m_{bb}$,
    to a linear combination of the reconstructed mass and the $p_T$s of the leading two jets ($p_{T,1}$
    and $p_{T,2}$), which takes advantage of correlations between $m_{bb}$, $p_{T,1}$ and $p_{T,2}$ 
    that are present for signal (and especially signal events with good mass resolution) to suppress
    the backgrounds
\end{itemize}


%The problem is significantly worse at higher masses;
%to some extent, this is inevitable because the intrinsic width of the Higgs resonance increases with $m_A$
%(quantification of this effect can be found in Figure~\ref{fig:width}). However, the intrinsic width goes up to about 12
%GeV (at $m_A$=800 GeV), while the width of the reconstructed mass peak goes up to several hundred GeV.
%With this in mind, it’s clear that other effects drive the mass resolution.  The following sections, 
%and the tactics documented in them that attempt to recover lost mass resolution, focus mainly 
%on two hypotheses: that the lost mass resolution arises from final state radiation (FSR), and/or
%that it arises from incorrectly picking the jets when reconstructing (combinatorics). 





\subsection{Validation of Qualitative Shape Differences}
The first question to ask is whether the high-mass $m_{bb}$ distributions are qualitatively lower-resolution than
the low-mass distributions–-in other words, whether the ratio of the width to the generated mass changes
as a function of mass. We probe this by ``normalizing'' the signal MC mass, dividing each entry in the $m_{bb}$
histogram by the nominal mass which was generated; for example, a signal MC event that was generated
with a Higgs mass of 350 GeV and reconstructed to have 300 GeV would be entered into the histogram
as (300/350). Repeating this normalization process for several mass points allows us to compare the
shapes for different $m_A$ values.
We find that even when the $m_{bb}$ distributions are renormalized, the high-mass distributions remain
wider than the low-mass distributions. That points toward FSR as a likely culprit, and in the following
sections we will detail several attempts at FSR recovery.
\begin{figure}[hbt]
  \includegraphics[width=0.78\linewidth]{SignalKin/mbb_normalized_signal.pdf}
  \caption{The normalized $m_{bb}$ distributions for several signal mass points. The mass resolution
  is qualitatively worse for higher-mass Higgs bosons.\label{fig:mbb_norm}}
\end{figure}





\subsection{Jet Reconstruction Modifications}
As noted in Section~\ref{sec:jet_reco}, this analysis uses anti-$k_t$ jets with a distance parameter
of R=0.4.  It is possible that, for a signficant number of jets, some of the radiation associated
with the jet is falling outside of the jet radius and is therefore lost during clustering and
reconstruction.  A way to test this hypothesis is to reconstruct the signal events with R=0.6
jets, and see if the mass resolution improves. 

We find that the mass resolution does get marginally better (narrower distribution and higher mean
for the $m_{bb}$ distribution) for high-mass signal MC events, but only by a few percent.
Practical concerns prevent R=0.6 jets from being a serious consideration: first, the background
would also be pushed toward higher masses as QCD jets are reconstructed with larger radii;
second, pileup calibration and removal would be a significantly larger concern; and third,
the $b$-tagging calibrations are created only for R=0.4 jets so the $b$-tagging systematics
would be much more difficult to quantify.  


\subsection{Topology-Based Energy Recovery Algorithm}
One hypothesis for the distribution of the FSR is that, for the high-\pt jets that result from the Higgs
daughter $b$-quarks, they might radiate away partons that are hard enough to be clustered into their own
jets (\pt$>$25 GeV) but end up nearby the leading jets in the detector (where nearby is defined as within
$\Delta R<$1.0). In other words, we look for a topology where there are one or more jets near one of the leading
two jets, and in cases where such jets are found, we add them back in when reconstructing $m_{bb}$.
This is found to have little effect on the mass resolution. In practice, only about 20\% of events
have the topology where additional jet(s) are found near the leading two jets, and the mass resolution
looks virtually unchanged before and after adding this correction. This suggests a couple of possible
conditions: either the FSR is too diffuse and/or low-energy to be clustered into jets, and/or it is farther
than the $\Delta R<$1.0 search zone allows for recovery.

  and after attempting the $p_T$-based and topology-based 
  FSR recovery algorithms, for several signal mass points. \label{fig:fsr_recovery}}
\end{figure}



\subsection{\pt-Based Energy Recovery Algorithm}
The \pt-based energy recovery algorithm is based on the idea that perhaps the FSR takes the form of one
or two very high-energy radiated partons that can end up far away from the leading two jets but can be
identified by their high $p_T$. In practice, what this means is looking for events with a non-$b$-tagged jet that
has \pt$>$80 GeV, and when one is found, adding this back in when reconstructing $m_{bb}$.
Unfortunately the effect on the mass resolution is negligible. A few events move out of the low-mass
tail, and the high-mass tail gets a few more events as jets can be mistakenly added back in even when no
FSR was lost.






\subsection{$n_{jets}$ Dependence}
\label{sec:n_jets_sig}

The signal mass resolution also displays a large dependence on $n_{jets}$, the 
number of central\footnote{central is defined here as $|\eta|<2.5$} 
jets over 25 GeV in the event.  If the event has significant FSR,
that radiation can end up clustered into extra jets in the event, and the 
mass resolution suffers at the same time.  In events where there are only three jets,
we can say rather confidently that two of the jets come from the Higgs decay
and the third is from the associated production; as long as we pick the jets
properly, the mass resolution should not show major effects of FSR.  That 
better resolution propagates through to allow the fit an easier time in distinguishing
signal from background, and generally gives better sensitivity than 
when the signal has poor mass resolution, all other things being equal.  
That motivates our decision in the fitting step of the analysis to treat
the 3-jet, 4-jet, and 5 or more jet events separately, and only combine at the
end when computing the net sensitivity.  More details on that procedure can 
be found in Section~\ref{subsec:fitmodel}.

\section{Eigenvector Rotation}
\label{sec:rotation}

Once the events have been categorized based on $b$-tag status and the number of jets in the
events, but before doing the final fit, we apply a change of variables based on
$p_T$s of the leading two jets and $m_{bb}$ in each event.  These three kinematic variables
as the discriminating variable (rather than $m_{bb}$).  This section details the 
motivation and procedure of the variable change, which helps separate the
signal and background in the final search and results in an analysis 
sensitivity that is 15-50\% better than an analysis without these steps.



The motivation for this variable change strategy has its origins in trying to control the effect of
FSR on the analysis sensitivity.  At high $m_A$, the jets from the Higgs (and also 
the associated $b$-quark) have large $p_T$, which they then tend to radiate away 
as FSR.  This causes the $m_{bb}$ peak to smear out and be more difficult to 
distinguish from background than in the lower-$m_A$ cases.  However, since FSR
occurs stochastically on an event-by-event basis, a subset of the signal events
will have little or no FSR and will reconstruct to (nearly) $m_A$\footnote{modulo any
systematic errors in the jet reconstruction, calorimeter noise, etc.}--if these events 
can be isolated from the others, they offer a chance to improve the sensitivity
via the improved mass resolution and signal-to-background ratio. 

A simple strategy might be to apply a cut to the $p_T$ of the leading and/or 
second jet in the event, and only accept events where the $p_T$ is above some
threshold optimized by comparing signal MC to \textit{bbanti} data.  
That would isolate events with poor mass resolution (i.e. lots of FSR) from
those with little FSR and better reconstruction properties.  However, since
there is a correlation between $p_{T,1}$, $p_{T,2}$ and $m_{bb}$, a cut like
this ends up sculpting the background as well.  In addition, the $p_{T,1}$ and
$p_{T,2}$ cut thresholds that looked best on signal MC are ``too good'' on 
background-dominated \textit{bbanti} events and there is no background
above a certain $m_{bb}$ value.  That makes modeling the background extremely 
difficult, and any fit difficult to validate.  

The rotation is performed as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item For each variable $m_{bb}$, $p_{T,1}$ and $p_{T,2}$, calculate the mean 
    of all signal MC simulation events, and subtract it from each event
    \item For each event, fill a 3$\times$3 tensor with the following components
    \begin{equation}
        \begin{bmatrix}
        m_{bb}m_{bb} & m_{bb}p_{T,1} & m_{bb}p_{T,2} \\
                     & p_T^1 p_{T,1} & p_{T,1} p_{T,2} \\
                     &               & p_{T,2} p_{T,2} \\ 
        \end{bmatrix}
    \end{equation}
    (the matrix is symmetric, so we write only the elements above the diagonal for
    brevity and clarity)
    \item Sum these tensor matrices for all signal events in a given $n_{jets}$ category;
    do not differentiate based on tag category
    (the resulting tensor will also be 3$\times$3)
    \item Find the leading eigenvector\footnote{where the leading eigenvector is the
    eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue} of the tensor matrix
    \item Define the $m_{bb}^{'}$ variable as follows:
    \begin{equation}
        m_{bb}^{'} = [m_{bb}\ p_{T,1}\ p_{T,2}] \cdot [e_1\ e_2\ e_3]
    \end{equation}
    where the latter vector is the leading eigenvector of the tensor matrix
    \item perform this transformation for each signal mass point separately
\end{itemize}

After this rotation, $m_{bb}^{'}$ is an admixture of $m_{bb}$, $p_{T,1}$, and 
$p_{T,2}$.  The exact contribution from each of these variables changes on a mass-point-by-mass-point
basis, as the correlations between them change.  At lower masses, $m_{bb}$ provides
most of the basis for $m_{bb}^{'}$, with 76\% of the $m_{bb}^{'}$ coming from 
$m_{bb}$.  At higher masses, where FSR is more of an issue, the correlations between 
$m_{bb}$ and the leading jets' $p_T$s are more important and for $m_A$=800 GeV,
over half of $m_{bb}^{'}$ (55\%) comes from $p_{T,1}$ and $p_{T,2}$.  The full set 
of $m_{bb}^{'}$ components can be found in Table~\ref{tab:eigenvector_elements}.


%Adding a change of basis before the $p_T$ cuts turns out to offer the advantage
%of better signal/background separation without the cost of making the background
%difficult to model.  The basis change is a rotation away from the $p_T^1$, 
%$p_T^2$, $m_{bb}$ basis into what we call the $p_T^{1'}$, $p_T^{2'}$, $m_{bb}^{'}$
%basis, where $p_T^{1'}$, $p_T^{2'}$, $m_{bb}^{'}$ are the eigenvectors of 
%a matrix built out of $p_T^1$, $p_T^2$, and $m_{bb}$.  The leading eigenvector 
%\footnote{the leading eigenvector is defined as the eigenvector with the largest
%associated eigenvalue}, which we call $m_{bb}^{'}$, is an admixture of 
%$p_T^1$, $p_T^2$, and $m_{bb}$, the exact blend of which varies by signal mass
%point.  The relative contributions of $p_T^1$, $p_T^2$, and $m_{bb}$ to the $m_{bb}^{'}$
%leading eigenvector can be seen in Table~\ref{tab:eigenvector_elements}.

The effect of this transformation on 450 and 800 GeV signal and background-dominated
data can be seen in Figure ~\ref{fig:transformed_vars}.  These figures show
the difference in the $m_{bb}$ distributions %and $p_T$ distributions 
before and after the transformation,
with the mass distribution being pushed to lower values
in the background distribution while the signal mass maintains a similar shape.  
This background reshaping affects the signal to background ratio in the 
neighborhood of the signal peak; before the rotation,
significant background remains in the neighborhood of the signal peak, 
but after the rotation the signal is virtually
unchanged while the background has been shifted lower.

\caption{ Comparisons of the signal and background $m_{bb}$ distributions
    before and after the rotation.  The left two plots show 450 GeV and 800 GeV
    Higgs mass points before the rotation. The signal is extremely small compared to the background, whereas the 
    same distributions (including the same signal normalization) after the rotation
    are on the right, for the same two mass points.  The rotation pushes the
    background events to lower values of $m_{bb}^{'}$ than the signal, yielding
    better signal/background separation, especially for higher mass Higgs candidates.
     \label{fig:transformed_vars}}
\end{figure}


While the $m_{bb}^{'}$ variable is derived using the leading eigenvector of the
tensor matrix, the second and third eigenvectors can also be used in an analagous
way and we refer to the resulting transformed variables as $p_{T,1}^{'}$ and $p_{T,2}^{'}$.


There is one more step that optimizes the signal to background
discrimination further, which is placing cuts on $p_{T,1}^{'}$ and $p_{T,2}^{'}$.
If we require that $p_{T,1}^{'}>-10$ GeV, and $p_{T,2}^{'}>-50$ GeV, it 
excludes a region of $m_{bb}^{'}$ phase space where the modeling is difficult
and little sensitivity is gained.  

Since the rotation is calculated on each signal mass point separately, and the
mass points are characterized by different correlations between $m_{bb}^{'}$, 
$p_{T,1}$ and $p_{T,2}$, in particular because the mass resolution varies
significantly based on the mass of $H/A$.  As a result, the background will change
as a function of the signal mass point.  The signal and background shapes 
after the rotation can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:sig_bkg_after_rotation}.

background further to the left (lower $m^{'}_{bb}$ values) for higher mass
signal points.

\end{figure}





\subsubsection{Binned Fit to Signal}

The signal shape is fit using an RhhBinnedPdf in RooFit, a form of parameterized
histogram where the parameterization helps the fit converge more reliably and allows
a single parameter to capture the integral (i.e. signal yield) of the distribution.
Once the full analysis cut chain has been applied, including the rotation, the 
signal $m_{bb}^{'}$ distributions are fit in signal MC and then the shapes are fixed.


The search range in $m^{'}_{bb}$ varies by mass point.  As Figure~\ref{fig:sig_bkg_after_rotation}
shows, the background can shift significantly from left to right depending on the details
of the (mass-point-specific) rotation, so in particular the low edge of the search window
can be moved to more negative values of $m^{'}_{bb}$  when one is looking for a high-mass $H/A$,
than when searching for an $H/A$ with a lower mass.  The mass windows for each search
point are listed in Table~\ref{tab:mass_windows}.

\begin{table}
    \caption{The search windows in $m^{'}_{bb}$, based on the signal mass point 
    under investigation.  The background gets pushed to lower values of $m^{'}_{bb}$ 
    by the rotation for higher signal mass values, which allows for wider mass 
    windows for higher signal mass points.  \label{tab:mass_windows}}
    \begin{tabular}{ c c c } \hline \hline 
    signal mass point & low edge $m^{'}_{bb}$  &  high edge $m^{'}_{bb}$ \\ \hline
    450 GeV & -50 & 350 \\
    500 GeV & -90 & 350 \\ 
    550 GeV & -130 & 350 \\
    600 GeV & -130 & 350 \\
    650 GeV & -170 & 350 \\
    700 GeV & -210 & 350 \\
    800 GeV & -250 & 350 \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

For all fits, the histogram bins are 40 GeV wide.  20 GeV binning was also investigated,
as well as variable-width binning, but there were only negligible differences in the
final sensitivity based on with bin widths.

%The mass range for the signal fits (and also the background fits) is -50 GeV $< m_{bb}^{'}<$ 350 GeV,
%and the bins are 40 GeV wide in a compromise between trying to capture as much
%shape information as possible while also dealing with limited signal MC statistics.

The choice of a parameterized histogram was taken after it was found that 
the signal distribution is a difficult one to fit to a function, since the shape can vary
widely by jet bin and $b$-tag category.  Attempts to fit the distributions with e.g. a 
Cruijff function (a bifurcated Gaussian function with non-Gaussian tails) would work
well for some categories and signal mass points, but fail to give good shape descriptions
for other categories and signal mass points.  By fitting to a histogram, we are able
to fit more difficult shapes than could be reliably fit with a function, and the fits are
more stable under the addition of perturbations from systematic errors.


%http://www.slac.stanford.edu/econf/C0303241/proc/pres/502.PDF
%The signal $m_{bb}$ shape is fit with a Cruijff PDF.  The Cruijff function is a 
%bifurcated Gaussian (different widths for left and right sides of the distribution) with non-Gaussian tails: 

%\begin{equation}
%f(x) = exp((x-m_{bb})^2 / (2\sigma^2_{L,R} + \alpha_{L,R}(x-m)^2))
%\end{equation}

%The signal MC distributions and fit results can be seen in Figures
