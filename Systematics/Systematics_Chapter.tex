\chapter[Systematic Errors]{Systematic Errors}

The last step in computing a result in experimental physics involves identifying
and quantifying sources of systematic error.  Systematic errors arise from calibration
errors, data/MC disagreement, detector uncertainty, noise, and other sources
that do not decrease as the overall dataset size increases.  


\section{Trigger $p_T$ Efficiency}
\label{sec:trigger_syst}

The trigger can introduce systematic effects that must be quantified as uncertainties; 
this can happen in two ways on this analysis.  Since the trigger efficiency is estimated
for signal using MC simulations, it is possible that detector mismodelings in the MC 
simulation process can over- or under-estimate the trigger efficiency as a function 
of the $p_T$ of the jets in the event.  We call this the trigger $p_T$ efficiency,
and we estimate and correct for it by parameterizing the turn-on curve with a logistic
function, and using the ratio of the function between data and MC to calculate and 
apply scale factors that get applied to the MC events falling in the turn-on curve.  
The second source of trigger mismodeling comes from the online $b$-tag that is
included in the trigger, but because of correlations between the online and offline tagging,
we estimate this uncertainty as part of the $b$-tagging sytematic (Section ~\ref{sec:SF}).


The general idea behind the trigger turn-on curve is that the overall trigger efficiency
is more volatile if one or both of the relevant jets are near the $p_T$ thresholds.
Since there are two jets in the EF\_2b35\_loose\_j145\_j35\_a4tchad trigger, with thresholds
of 145 and 35 GeV respectively, events with jets near these values should be assessed
for systematic errors.  However, since this is a multi-object trigger (requiring $b$-tags
in addition to the two jets), the efficiency for a given event can be a complex function
of the $p_T$ of the leading jet, the second jet, and the $b$-tagging characteristics of
the jets in the event.  In order to factorize out these effects, we place tight offline
cuts on all objects in the trigger \textit{except} the object under examination. For example, 
to compute the trigger turn-on curve for the leading jet, we place the following cuts before
computing any efficiencies: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item at least 60 GeV $p_T$ for the second jet
    \item two jets in the event must pass L2 and EF $b$-tags
\end{itemize}

These cuts effectively remove inefficiencies due to the second jet or the $b$-tagging,
since the second jet $p_T$ cut (60 GeV) is well into the efficiency plateau for that
jet, and the requirement of 2 jets being $b$-tagged online removes events where the
jet $p_T$ is high enough, but the event fails to trigger because of the $b$-tagging requirement.  
In this discussion the same algorithm is applied to quantify
the trigger turn-on of both the leading and sub-leading jet, but for brevity we will
refer only to the leading jet.  The parameterized turn-on curves for the leading and 
sub-leading jets in signal MC and data can be found in Figure~\ref{fig:trigger_turn_on_1}.

For signal MC we can then compute the efficiency as a function of the leading jet $p_T$ by
examining the leading jet $p_T$ of events that both do and do not pass the trigger.
Residual inefficiencies remaining from the second jet $p_T$, and the $b$-tagging requirements,
would show up in the form of the distribution plateauing slightly below 100\% efficiency;
the logistic function will identify the plateau efficiency and the residual error can be corrected when
computing the trigger efficiency for a given jet $p_T$.  The logistic function used for 
fitting has the mathematical form $\epsilon = \frac{b}{1+exp^{c-a*p_T}}$.  The values found
by ROOT for the parameters of this function are as follows:

For the turn-on curves in the data, the procedure is slightly different.  Unlike in signal
MC, there is no direct way of querying which events would have passed the trigger, but failed
because the leading jet $p_T$ was not above threshold; those events are simply rejected by 
the trigger and never recorded.  In that sense, the data collected by the trigger is biased.
However, some heavily prescaled trigger items with minimum or zero bias are collected for 
the express purpose of trigger calibrations.  The ones that are used in this analysis are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item EF\_rd0\_filled\_NoAlg: the L1 trigger is fired randomly, then the event proceeds
    through the normal L2 and EF reconstruction without any decision being taken
    \item EF\_j145\_a4tchad: the $p_T$ requirement on the leading jet is the same as in 
    the analysis trigger, but no second jet $p_T$ or $b$-tagging requirement is in place
    \item EF\_j35\_a4tchad: the same as EF\_j145\_a4tchad, but with the appropriate $p_T$ 
    threshold to calibrate the second jet
\end{itemize}

Only the EF\_rd0\_filled\_NoAlg trigger is truly unbiased, but because of its heavy prescale,
there are no events in data that are accepted by both this trigger and the EF\_2b35\_loose\_j145\_j35\_a4tchad
analysis trigger.  However, we can do a two-step calibration using EF\_j145\_a4tchad and
EF\_j35\_a4tchad as intermediate steps, as those have plenty of events that overlap 
with both the analysis trigger and the zero-bias trigger.

Once the turn-on curves are parameterized in both data and MC, the difference between the efficiencies
can be computed and applied as a scale factor for events that fall in the turn-on region.

\section{Jet Energy Scale and Resolution}
\label{sec:jes}
Hadronic particles fragment via QCD in the ATLAS detector, leaving deposits of 
energy in the calorimeters that must be clustered and reconstructed into jets.  The
observed jets then need some correction so that, on average, the reconstructed
jet energy corresponds to the energy of the associated stable particles.  The
calibration for this correction, called the jet energy scale (JES) and jet
energy resolution (JER), is calculated using MC simulations and then checked
in data.  The residual uncertainty on the JES and JER is then a systematic 
error on the analysis.

There are a number of sources of JES uncertainty, each of which has an associated error.
All the sources are listed here for completeness, but some are not used for reasons
as noted:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 6 nuisance parameters from in-situ analyses (Z+jet balance, photon+jet balance, and
    multi-jet balance) that are reduced from an original list of 60 that encompasses effects
    such as uncertainties in calorimeter response, the JES calibration method, and modelling
    in Monte Carlo generators
    %\item 2 nuisance parameters associated with flavor composition and flavor response (not used, see next item)
    \item 2 nuisance parameters from $\eta$ intercalibration
    \item 4 nuisance parameters associated with pileup (relative offsets for NPV and $\mu$,
    the $p_T$ of the pileup, and the $\rho$ topology)
    \item 1 nuisance parameter that quantifies the flavor composition and flavor
    response associated with $b$-jets
    %\item 1 nuisance parameter associated with MC non-closure (not used since this 
    %is needed to correct non-MC12a samples, but the signal MC was generated as part of MC12a)
    %\item 1 nuisance parameter for punch-through jets (not used because the signal MC
    %was generated using AFII for detector simulation)
\end{itemize} 

The jet energy scale and its associated uncertainties are estimated using
in situ and test-beam-based measurements of isolated hadron response \cite{jes}.  The systematic
errors are integrated into the analysis via 14 independent variations, which are multiplicative factors applied to the jet
4-vectors and then the adjusted 4-vectors are run through the analysis framework.
The adjusted $m_{bb}$ distributions from the new 4-vectors are propagated through the fit as systematic
errors.  The effect of the jet energy scale varies depending on the signal mass
point, from about 3\% per variation at 400 GeV to $<$1\% at 800 GeV.

Similarly, the jet energy resolution is measured using dijet balance measurements and 
a dijet bisection technique \cite{jer}, in
order to quantify the jet resolution or $\sigma p_T/p_T$.  Data and MC are 
found to agree to within 14\% for central ($|y|<$2.8) jets with $p_T$ betweeen
20 and 80 GeV.

\textbf{there is only a single NP for JER; provide that uncertainty per mA point here}

\section{$b$-Tagging Scale Factors}
\label{sec:SF}
Although every effort is made to accurately simulate the production rates and
kinematic properties of $b$-quarks, as well as the performance of the ATLAS
detector, it is difficult to imagine that Monte Carlo simulation perfectly represents
the $b$-tagging efficiencies that might be found in data.  At the same time, it
is challenging to derive pure data-driven samples of $b$, $c$ and light jets to which
the b-tagging can then be applied, and used to derive the efficiencies:

    \begin{equation}
        eff_{b,c,light}=\frac{number\ of\ truth\ b,\ c,\ light}{number\ of\ tagged\ b,\ c,\ light}
    \end{equation}

Scale factors are computed by the flavor tagging performance group to quantify the
difference between the data and MC efficiencies.

    \begin{equation}
        eff_{data}=eff_{MC}\times SF_{data}
    \end{equation}


The scale factors are applied as events weights to the MC weight, where the value
of the scale factor depends on the $p_T$, $\eta$, $b$-tagging working point, 
and truth flavor of the jet under examination.  
When there are multiple jets being examined for $b$-tags in a single
event, the net event weight is a product of all the relevant scale factors.
In this analysis, since only the first 5 jets are relevant for determining 
whether an event passes the analysis cuts or which $b$-tag category ($bbb$, 
$bbloose$, or $bbanti$), no scale factors are applied for jets that are 6th
or lower in the $p_T$ hierarchy of an event.

\subsection{Offline $b$-Tagging}
The scale factors are calculated by comparing the $b$-tagging efficiency computed 
in MC to the efficiency measured in carefully curated data samples, where the truth
flavor contents of the data are relatively well-known \cite{b-tagging}.  For the $b$-jet
scale factors, a sample of $t\bar{t}$ events is used for the data component; for 
$c$-jets, the calibration is done with $D^*$ events.

The scale factors are used to correct the MC $b$-tagging performance back to the $b$-tagging
behavior seen in data, but the calibration process can introduce systematic uncertainties
that have to be quantified and propagated through to the final result.  The $b$-tagging
systematics are computed and applied using a method called the eigenvector method.
The eigenvector method is used to derive a set of independent variations of the data-MC scale
factors, in such a way to take the full covariance matrix of the calibration measurements
into account, including correlations among working points and different jet $p_{T}$ regions.
For further explanation of the eigenvector method please see section 2.3 of \cite{VHBTagging}. 

\subsection{$b$-Tagging in the Trigger}
The presence of $b$-tagging in the trigger means the sample of data collected for this 
analysis is already enriched in jets that look more $b$-like, which must also 
be taken into account during the calibration process.  The scale factors
are computed separately based on how a jet is tagged (online, offline, or both). 
For each of these permutations, a different scale factor is retrieved (for
example, jets that are tagged offline are separated from their non-tagged counterparts
before the online scale factors are computed).  Then the scale factors are combined
for an overall event weight as usual.
