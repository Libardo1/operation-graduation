\section{Jet Energy Scale and Resolution}
\label{sec:jes}
Hadronic particles fragment via QCD in the ATLAS detector, leaving deposits of 
energy in the calorimeters that must be clustered and reconstructed into jets.  The
observed jets then need some correction so that, on average, the reconstructed
jet energy corresponds to the energy of the associated stable particles.  The
calibration for this correction, called the jet energy scale (JES) and jet
energy resolution (JER), is calculated using MC simulations and then checked
in data.  The residual uncertainty on the JES and JER is then a systematic 
error on the analysis. 

The jet energy scale and its associated uncertainties are estimated using
in situ and test-beam-based measurements of isolated hadron response \cite{jes}.  The systematic
errors are integrated into the analysis via 14 independent variations, which are multiplicative factors applied to the jet
4-vectors and then the adjusted 4-vectors are run through the analysis framework.
The adjusted $m_{bb}$ distributions from the new 4-vectors are propagated through the fit as systematic
errors.  The effect of the jet energy scale varies depending on the signal mass
point, from about 3\% per variation at 400 GeV to $<$1\% at 800 GeV.

\subsubsection{$b$-Tagging Scale Factors}
\label{sec:SF}
Although every effort is made to accurately simulate the production rates and
kinematic properties of $b$-quarks, as well as the performance of the ATLAS
detector, it is difficult to imagine that Monte Carlo simulation perfectly represents
the b-tagging efficiencies that might be found in data.  At the same time, it
is challenging to derive pure data-driven samples of $b$, $c$ and light jets to which
the b-tagging can then be applied, and used to derive the efficiencies:

    \begin{equation}
        eff_{b,c,light}=\frac{number\ of\ truth\ b,\ c,\ light}{number\ of\ tagged\ b,\ c,\ light}
    \end{equation}

Scale factors are computed by the flavor tagging performance group to quantify the
difference between the data and MC efficiencies.

    \begin{equation}
        eff_{data}=eff_{MC}\times SF_{data}
    \end{equation}


The eigenvector method is used to derive a set of independent variations of the data-MC scale
factors, in such a way to take the full covariance matrix of the calibration measurements
into account, including correlations among working points and different jet $p_{T}$ regions.
For further explanation of the eigenvector method please see section 2.3 of% ~\ref{ref:VHBTagging}. 
%GP Soon we can reference the cont. tagging conf note (for now ATLAS-COM-CONF-2014-003).

The scale factors used in this analysis are grouped by whether they are applied to jets in the
tight, loose or anti-tagged bins.  The nominal values for the scale factors, as well as the results
given by the eigenvector variations, and can be found in Appendix~\ref{sec:SF}.

When the eigenvector variations are applied and their effect propagated through the matrix method,
we can ask what the effect is on the total number of $b$, $c$, and light jets predicted.
There are 12 variations each for $b$ and $c$ jets, and 24 variations for light jets, so
overall there are 48 variations that need to be examined.

%\subsection{Systematic Errors on Data-Driven Background Estimates}
%Validating the matrix method predictions of the $m_{bb}$ shap is a bit more subtle. 
%Since we use the matrix method to help validate our assumption that mbb of the leading 2 jets is independent of the truth
% flavor of the third jet, we need to demonstrate that the matrix method reweighting does not distort the
% mbb shape. We test this by generating toy MC distributions where our assumption is incorrect (by design,
% we make the mbb distribution dependent on the truth flavor of the 3rd jet) and then run those toy events
% through the matrix method to check if the different distributions are projected out correctly.
% Using the $m_{bb}$ distribution in data as a template, we generate three $m_{bb}$ distributions that have different
% shapes (the $m_{bb}$ values are scaled down by 7\% for light jets, left unchanged for charm jets, and scaled
% up by 15\% for bottom jets), and draw an $m_{bb}$ value at random from one of those distributions depending
% on the truth flavor. These different $m_{bb}$ distributions are not meant to model the data in any physically
% relevant way, but rather to guarantee that if there are systematic differences in $m_{bb}$ that are correlated
% with the flavor of the third jet, the matrix method will get the $m_{bb}$ shape correct.
% The results of this study can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:mbb_compare_truth_mm_toy}; it is clear that the 
%shape differences in the original distributions propagate through to the matrix method predictions.
